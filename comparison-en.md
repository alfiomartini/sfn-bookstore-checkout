### Table: Aspects and Step Functions

| **Aspect**                      | **Step Functions**                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation Style**        | Code-first, declarative via SAM templates                                                 |
| **State Management**            | State is natively managed in Step Functions (via InputPath, OutputPath, etc.)             |
| **Error Handling**              | Advanced, with Catch, Retry, and Failure Paths for each state                             |
| **AWS Integration**             | Native integration with AWS services such as Lambda, SNS, SQS                             |
| **Asynchronous Execution**      | Task tokens and decoupled invocations enable asynchronous execution                       |
| **Scalability**                 | Automatically scales with AWS infrastructure, no need to manage workers                   |
| **Visual Representation**       | The Step Functions workflow is defined in SAM templates and visualized in the AWS Console |
| **Learning Curve**              | Requires familiarity with AWS services and SAM templates                                  |
| **Definition Flexibility**      | Highly flexible with custom Lambda functions and other AWS services                       |
| **Stateful vs Stateless**       | Stateful – the workflow maintains state                                                   |
| **Parallelism and Concurrency** | Supports parallelism via Parallel state and waiting for tasks                             |

### Table: Aspects and Camunda 8 SaaS

| **Aspect**                      | **Camunda 8 SaaS**                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Implementation Style**        | Model-based, visual BPMN with predefined tasks                                                               |
| **State Management**            | State is stored in process variables, easily manipulated via Script Tasks                                    |
| **Error Handling**              | Handled through error events and BPMN error boundaries (Catch Events)                                        |
| **AWS Integration**             | Integration via connectors, such as Lambda Connector for direct invocation                                   |
| **Asynchronous Execution**      | Service tasks with connectors can be asynchronous, using external workers or the connector's built-in worker |
| **Scalability**                 | Managed by Camunda, automatic scalability, but custom workers might be needed                                |
| **Visual Representation**       | Camunda 8 provides a fully editable BPMN diagram                                                             |
| **Learning Curve**              | Requires understanding of BPMN and process modeling in Camunda                                               |
| **Definition Flexibility**      | Flexible BPMN modeling with advanced tasks, subprocesses, and connectors                                     |
| **Stateful vs Stateless**       | Stateful – the state is stored in process variables                                                          |
| **Parallelism and Concurrency** | Supports parallelism through multi-instance tasks, event-based gateways, etc.                                |
